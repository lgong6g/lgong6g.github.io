Hi! I am a final year PhD student at Universitäts-Sternwarte München (USM) and Max Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics (MPE), Germany. My researches mainly focus on weak gravitational lensing, large-scale structure in the Universe and machine learning applications to cosmology. My supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/) and [Dr. Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~stella/stella.html).
