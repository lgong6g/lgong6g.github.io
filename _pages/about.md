Hi! I am a final year PhD student at [Universitäts-Sternwarte München (USM)](https://www.physik.lmu.de/observatory/de/) and [Max Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main), Germany. My researches mainly focus on weak gravitational lensing, large-scale structure in the Universe and machine learning (ML) applications to cosmology. My supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/) and [Dr. Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~stella/stella.html). My collaborators include [Prof. Annabelle Bohrdt](https://sites.google.com/view/annabelle-bohrdt?pli=1), [Dr. Sandrine Codis](https://sandrinecodis.wixsite.com/sandrinewebsite), [Dr. Anik Halder](https://anikhalder.github.io), [Dr. Alexandre Barthelemy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s_F6pIsAAAAJ&hl=fr) and others.

My main scientific goal is to use two approaches: the analytical modeling and ML application, hopefully also a meaningful combination of the two, to better understand our Universe in terms of structure formation and evolution, statistical inference for '$\Lambda$'CDM and beyond standard cosmological model. So far, my work has involved tools such as perturbation theory with bias expansion, emulation techniques, and convolutional neural networks. I have applied these methods to both simulated and observational weak gravitational lensing data, including Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DESY3) data. For details, please check my publications.

I was born and raised in the city of Hefei, Anhui Province, China and went to Hong Kong in 2015 to receive my undergrduate education in the [University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk). I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree, major in Physics and minor in mathematics and astronomy, in 2019. In the same year I moved to Munich, Germany to pursue a master diploma study at USM in astrophysics. Later on in 2021, I graduated from the program and started my PhD in astronomy since 2022.

I am an enthusiast in history, in my leisure time, I enjoy reading history works and traveling to different countries to visit historic sites. Some of my favorite hitorians are 钱穆, 吕思勉, Yoshio Kawakatsu, Michio Tanigawa, Fernand Braudel (the list can go on). 

If you are interested in a collaboration, or even just a small scientific chat, feel free to contact me by my email.
