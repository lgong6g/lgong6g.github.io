Hi! I am a final year PhD student at Universitäts-Sternwarte München (USM) and Max Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics (MPE), Germany. My researches mainly focus on weak gravitational lensing, large-scale structure in the Universe and machine learning(ML) applications to cosmology. My supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/) and [Dr. Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~stella/stella.html). My collaborators include [Prof. Annabelle Bohrdt](https://sites.google.com/view/annabelle-bohrdt?pli=1), [Dr. Sandrine Codis](https://sandrinecodis.wixsite.com/sandrinewebsite), [Dr. Anik Halder](https://anikhalder.github.io), [Dr. Alexandre Barthelemy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s_F6pIsAAAAJ&hl=fr) and others.

My main scientific goal is to use two approaches: the analytical modeling and ML application, hopefully also a meaningful combination of the two, to better understand our Universe in terms of structure formation and evolution, statistical inference and beyond standard cosmological model. 

If you are interested in a collaboration, or even just a small scientific chat, feel free to contact me by my email.
