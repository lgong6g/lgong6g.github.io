Hi! I am a final year PhD student at [Universitäts-Sternwarte München (USM)](https://www.physik.lmu.de/observatory/de/) and [Max Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main), Germany. My researches mainly focus on weak gravitational lensing, large-scale structure in the Universe and machine learning (ML) applications to cosmology. My supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/) and [Dr. Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~stella/stella.html). My collaborators include [Prof. Annabelle Bohrdt](https://sites.google.com/view/annabelle-bohrdt?pli=1), [Dr. Sandrine Codis](https://sandrinecodis.wixsite.com/sandrinewebsite), [Dr. Anik Halder](https://anikhalder.github.io), [Dr. Alexandre Barthelemy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s_F6pIsAAAAJ&hl=fr) and others.

My main scientific goal is to use two approaches: the analytical modeling and ML application, hopefully also a meaningful combination of the two, to better understand our Universe in terms of structure formation and evolution, statistical inference for the standard and beyond cosmological model. So far, my work has involved tools such as perturbation theory with bias expansion, emulation techniques, and convolutional neural networks. I have applied these methods to both simulated and observational weak gravitational lensing data, including Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DESY3) data. For details, please check my publications.

I was born and raised in Hefei, Anhui Province, China, and in 2015, I moved to Hong Kong to pursue my undergraduate studies at the [University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk). I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree, majoring in Physics with minors in Mathematics and Astronomy. That same year, I moved to Munich, Germany, to begin a master’s program in astrophysics at USM. After graduating in 2021, I started my PhD in astronomy in 2022.

I am an enthusiast in history, in my leisure time, I enjoy reading history works and traveling to different countries to visit historic sites. Some of my favorite hitorians are 钱穆, 吕思勉, Yoshio Kawakatsu, Michio Tanigawa, Fernand Braudel (the list can go on). 

If you are interested in a collaboration, or even just a small scientific chat, feel free to contact me by my email.
