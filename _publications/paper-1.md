This paper is about preparing the statistical inference pipeline and modeling the survey systematic effects for the so called integrated shear 3-point correlation function. This particular statistic can be used to extract cosmological information beyond Gaussianity and therefore improve the constraints on cosmological parameters when combined with the conventional 2-point correlation functions. We used the state-of-the-art emulator to speed up our theoretical calculation and exploited affine sampling on GPU to accelerate the MCMC process.
