I supervised a master student, [Sijin Chen](https://chen-sijin.github.io/Sijin-Chen.github.io/), on his [master program thesis](https://chen-sijin.github.io/Sijin-Chen.github.io/files/thesis/Sijin_Master_Thesis.pdf). Sijin submitted his thesis on 12.05.2025 and currently is searching for a PhD position.
